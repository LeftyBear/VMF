# VMF Publisher Handoff

Status  : Phase 4 local-only verification complete / 0.0.1-dev GitHub prerelease published
Scope   : Handoff for next worker, next chat, Codex, or Work Mode
Depends : docs/development/CURRENT_STATUS.md, docs/development/Publisher_Phase4_LocalVerificationEvidence.md, docs/development/Publisher_Phase4_LocalVerificationChecklist.md, docs/distribution/ReleaseChecklist.md

This document is the handoff boundary for continuing VMF Publisher work after
Phase 4 local-only verification and the completed `0.0.1-dev` GitHub
prerelease publication. It is intended to prevent accidental new release gate
movement while Avast false positive vendor clearance remains pending.

Subsequent update: ADR-0019 records VMF-side residual risk acceptance and the
Release Hold lift. The `0.0.1-dev` tag, GitHub prerelease, and asset upload are
recorded complete in `CURRENT_STATUS.md` and the release records. Avast vendor
clearance remains not obtained, Avast safety certification is not claimed, and
this handoff does not authorize any new package, tag, release, publication,
Live E2E, Google Docs / Drive mutation, or flagged executable run.

## 1. Starting State

Begin from this state:

- Phase 4 local-only verification safety scope is complete;
- current state is local verification complete / Release Hold lifted by VMF
  risk acceptance / `0.0.1-dev` GitHub prerelease published;
- Avast false positive handling is pending;
- Avast vendor clearance has not been obtained and Avast safety certification
  is not claimed;
- `0.0.1-dev` release, tag, publication, package, Live E2E, Google Docs
  mutation, and Google Drive mutation are historical completed release-path
  records, not authorization for new operations;
- Frozen specifications, public APIs, and production design remain unchanged.

Local verification completion is not release readiness.

## 2. Stop Line

For any new release-path work after the published `0.0.1-dev` prerelease, do
not perform:

- Release;
- Git tag creation;
- Publication;
- New package creation;
- Package update;
- Live E2E;
- Google Docs mutation;
- Google Drive mutation;
- Re-running flagged artifacts without exact operation-specific authorization;
- Frozen specification changes;
- Public API changes;
- Production design changes.

If a requested task requires any gated operation, stop and report the exact
operation and required authorization. Do not infer authorization from Phase 4
local-only verification, ADR-0019, or the completed `0.0.1-dev` publication.

## 3. Allowed Work

The following work may continue when it remains non-release, non-live, and
non-mutating:

- Build;
- Unit tests;
- Non-live integration tests;
- Mock-based verification;
- Dry-run verification;
- Existing package inspection;
- Format check;
- Documentation consistency check.

Existing package inspection must remain inspection only unless a separate
operation-specific authorization names a broader action. Inspection must not
create, replace, update, publish, or approve a package, and it must not re-run a
flagged artifact without explicit authorization.

## 4. Next Actions

Recommended next actions are:

1. Track Avast false positive resolution without claiming vendor clearance.
2. Keep historical Phase 4-3 hold/block records as accepted-at-the-time
   evidence; use `CURRENT_STATUS.md` for the current state.
3. If a follow-up release is reconsidered, record the repository-owner decision
   before any tag, publication, package mutation, Live E2E, or flagged artifact
   re-run.
4. If Live E2E is requested, require explicit per-run authorization, credentials
   scope, destination scope, cleanup expectations, and exact command.
5. Keep vNext hardening work separate as candidate work before adoption.

The vNext hardening backlog currently includes:

- signing;
- MSI / installer;
- distribution verification;
- security / trust workflow.

## 5. Required Reporting For Future Work

Future local-only work should report:

- files changed;
- commands executed;
- pass, fail, blocked, pending, N/A, or not-executed result;
- warning count and error count when available;
- whether Live E2E was enabled;
- whether Google Docs or Google Drive were mutated;
- whether package creation or package update occurred;
- whether release, tag creation, publication, or announcement occurred;
- whether any flagged artifact was re-run;
- Git branch, staged state, commit state, push state, and working-tree status.

Blocked operations must be reported as not executed, blocked, or pending with a
reason. They must not be omitted.

## 7. Handoff Summary

Treat the repository as ready for local-only follow-up. Treat any new
release-path follow-up as separately gated, while preserving that `0.0.1-dev`
is already recorded as a published GitHub prerelease.

Proceed only inside the allowed scope unless the repository owner explicitly
reopens the relevant release gate or grants operation-specific authorization.
